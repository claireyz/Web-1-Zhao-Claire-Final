                    <li> The purpose of my portfolio is to showcase my work. I want it to have those Lightbox and gallery features. I would like to display my projects in an image gallery style that users would click into and bring them to a new page.

            <Essay q='S17. What is a Package Manager (e.g. NPM, Composer)? How does it play a role in software development?' >
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Package Manager:</b> A package manager keeps track of what software is installed on your computer. It lets you install new software, upgrade software to newer versions, or remove software that you previously installed. Package managers deal with packages: collections of files that are bundled together and can be installed and removed as a group. Some package managers are dependent on you installing other packages first in order to work. </li>
                    <li> <b> NPM:</b> NPM is the worldâ€™s largest registry for free open source node package managers. Software developers use NPM to share and upload packages for free. </li>
                    <li> <b> Composer:</b> Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. Composer challenges PHPâ€™s traditional single-script server usage by allowing package imports. Furthermore, Composer allows imports to be used traditionally from a server endpoint or simply from running scripts via the command line interchangeably. </li>
                    <li> <b> Role in software development:</b> A package manager is a programming languageâ€™s tool to create project environments and easily import external dependencies. You donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel and are able to make the most of the tools at your disposal. </li>
                </ul>
